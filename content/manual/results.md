Beside this tool, there are two more functionalities, highlighted in the picture: residual plot and results download. The first one displays the residuals of pressure and velocity fields obtained during the calculation, the latter instead allows to download the results in your local machine. This gives you access to advanced postprocessing functionalities with software such as [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/download/), available for Unix, Windows and OSx systems.

The file is downloaded in ZIP format, so uncompress it and open the ".case" file with the abovementioned Paraview.
