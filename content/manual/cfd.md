The CFD step represents the widest part of the whole simulation settings. The parameters present in the current step may vary according to the application chosen.

### Fluid Models

The first section is about defining the fluid models, turbulence and density in particular.

- *Flow type*: drop down list from which the user has to select the flow type
	- *Incompressible*: to simulate incompressible fluids like water, oil or air at low velocity.
	- *Compressible*: to simulate compressible ideal-fluids like air or gas in general

- *Turbulence*: drop down list from which the user has to select the turbulence model
	- *Laminar*: to simulate viscous flows in laminar regime
	- *k-epsilon*: to model turbulence via the two equations *k-epsilon* model ([reference](http://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/ke-chien.html))
	- *k-omega SST*: to model turbulence via the two equations *k-omega SST* model ([reference](http://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/sst.html))
	- *SA*: to model turbulence via the one equation *Spalart-Allmaras* model ([reference](http://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/spalart.html))

- *Fluid properties*: specification of the fluid properties parameters
- *Fluid initialization*: definition of the initial condition for the fluid variables

- *Turbulence initialization*: definition of the initial condition for the turbulent variables

We report here the most common initialization for the turbulent variables

- Turbulent kinetic energy: $k = \cfrac{3}{2} \left( \overline{u} \cdot I \right)^{2}$

- Turbulent dissipation rate: $\epsilon = \cfrac{0.09 k^{1.5}}{l}$

- Specific dissipation rate: $\omega = \cfrac{\sqrt{k}}{l}$

- Turbulent kinematic eddy viscosity: $\nu_{t} = \sqrt{\cfrac{3}{2}} \overline{u} \cdot I l$

where $I$ is the turbulence intensity (suggested between 1% and 10%) and l is the turbulence length scale, approximated with the hydraulic diameter $D_h$.

### Boundary Conditions

The boundary conditions are the fundamental stage of the CFD simulations. CONSELF gives you a multiple choice of boundaries, each of which is target for the peculiar application you are currently using. Here you are a brief summary of what you are required to insert.

{{< figure src="/conself-docs/images/BC_selection.png" alt="Velocity inlet boundary condition application to selected boundary \"asmo\"" title="Velocity inlet boundary condition application to selected boundary \"asmo\"" >}}

In this section it is possible to specify the boundary condition to apply to the flow. For instance, it is possible to define an inlet, an outlet or a wall. In order to do that the user has to specify for each flow variable its value (or gradient) at a specific boundary.

- *Boundary condition*: drop down list from which the user has to select every surface of which the geometry (and the bounding box) is composed in order to assign boundary conditions to it.

- *BC TYPE list*: a list of available boundary conditions to be assigned to every surface. Every choice of this list gives access to a certain number of parameters to be defined in order to process it correctly.

**In order to get hints and details about boundary conditions you may encounter check [this page](:Boundaries "wikilink").**

By default every surface is assigned an adiabatic no-slip wall boundary condition.

### Simulation Settings

- *Time scheme*: drop down list from which the user has to select which type of simulation they want to perform in terms of behavior in time
	- *Transient*: to setup a simulation where the focus is on how the flow changes in time, i.e. the quantities of interest are variable fluctuations over time
	- *Steady*: to setup a simulation where the focus is on the final flow configuration, i.e. the converged steady solution that does not change anymore

In case *Transient* scheme is chosen

- *Timestep*: time accuracy defining the requested temporal resolution.
- *Final time*: defines the final simulation time.
- *Output frequency*: rules how often simulation results are saved.

In case *Steady* scheme is chosen

- *Number of iterations*: number of iterations performed by the CFD solver. The higher the number, the more accurate the solution.
- *Output frequency*: specifies how often simulation results are saved for the visualization.

After completion of all fields, the user can finalize the step clicking on *Submit* button. This will start the **CFD** step application that will appear in the *Case in progress* section of the main *Simulation* page.

The CFD step usually requires a high number of iterations (few thousands) in order to produce accurate results.
